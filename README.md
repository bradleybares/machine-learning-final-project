# Machine Learning & Pattern Recognition Final Project

This final project is a part of the Machine Learning & Pattern Recognition course (EECE5644) at Northeastern University. The project is about the analysis of the [2023 Boston Property Assessment](https://data.boston.gov/dataset/property-assessment/resource/1000d81c-5bb5-49e8-a9ab-44cd042f1db2) dataset. The dataset contains 180,000 records of property assessment in Boston. The goal of this project is to predict the value of a property based on its features. The project incorporates data preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning techniques to achieve the goal. The project report can be found [here](https://github.com/bradleybares/machine-learning-final-project/blob/main/boston_property_analysis_report.pdf).
